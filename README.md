# BetterSelf
BetterSelf is a Discord Selfbot with "multiple" commands. I challenged myself to reach over 100 different commands in one SelfBot. (But we all know, this wont happen) :sweat_smile:

# Setup
1. **Download the newest version of [BetterSelf](https://github.com/LeshDev/BetterSelf/releases).jar** . Save this jar in any folder and execute the file. It will automaticly create a config.json file and a usercard.json file. If your OS is Windows it will also create a start.bat . You can use this file to start the Bot in a Command Promt. **NOTE:** The first time you start the jar it will close automaticly after creating all files.

2. **Before you restart the bot again** you must paste your Discord Token and your bot prefix (like +command) into the config.json . You will get your Discord Token in this tutorial: [Get your token](https://github.com/LeshDev/BetterSelf#get-your-token)

3. **Personalize your SelfBot** with your favourite color and own Embed Footer message. THIS FEATURE WILL COME LATER 

4. **It's time to start BetterSelf** - If your OS is Windows click on the previously generated start.bat and the bot will beginn to load. On other OS's I'm currently working on a launcher file. This will be avaible soon
